                                hole at the galaxy\'s center, some of it is accelerated
                                outward at nearly the speed of light along jets pointed
                                in opposite directions. When one of the jets happens to
                                be aimed in the direction of Earth, as illustrated here,
                                the galaxy appears especially bright and is classified as

                                low near the western horizon at sunset. With strong earthshine
                                it was joined by Saturn shining in the early evening sky for a
                                beautiful conjunction visible to skygazers around our fair planet.
